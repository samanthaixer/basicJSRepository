# Bank Tech Test

This tech test is an opportunity for me to practice my planning and design skills, and to remind myself how JavaScript works. I'd also like to practice dependency injection.

On top of all of that, this is a chance to showcase my ability to build professional-quality code. Checkout my portfolio to see more on what I consider to be good quality code.

[What code quality means to me]()

## Specification

### Requirements

- You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console. (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
- Deposits, withdrawal.
- Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
- Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).


### Acceptance criteria

- **Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012
- **And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012
- **And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012
- **When** she prints her bank statement
- **Then** she would see

```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```

## User Stories

```
As a user
So that I can add money to my account
I want to be able to make a deposit

As a user
So that I can take money out of my account
I want to be able to make a withdrawal

As a user
So that I can keep track of my money
I want to be able to produce a statement of my account showing the date, an amount and a balance
```

## Objects

`Account` - deposit, withdraw, balance, transactions, printStatement

`Transaction` - type(credit or debit), amount, date, print

## Dependencies
`Account` delegates the storing of each transaction to a `Transaction` object

`Account` delegates responsibility for printing each individual line to the transaction

When testing the `Account`, I should be able to inject `Transaction` objects

## Tests

What do I want to test?

### Unit tests

- `Transaction` -  adding a credit transaction, adding a debit transaction, validation?, valid date, readable printing

- `Account` - crediting or debitting the account updates the account balance, statement produces a list of transactions
